# Preparation

To learn, you must read & practice.

To learn cooking you read basic techniques of chefs and practice them. Or you're cooking with a mentor(mother/father/grandmother) that quickly tells you when you've made a mistake.

To learn a foreign language you read word definitions and practice saying them. Or you're with a relative in the country, quickly being told when you've said the wrong words.

There is no magic. There is no silver bullet. Some people read faster than others. Some people understand faster than others.

**The best way to prepare for gSchool/Turing/etc. is to start reading and practicing :)**


1. I take that back, the best way to prepare is to APPLY to both schools! Thats the reason you're reading this, right??? Both require that you are human and smart, neither require ANY programming experience.

1. 100% the easiest way to start reading/practicing is  -> [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby). This cannot be rushed. Your goal is to read the words and keep them in your brain. Do not try to understand everything. I didn't understand until a couple weeks into gschool and I was still better off from doing the tutorials beforehand.

1. If you haven't done any codecademy tutorials then go back to the previous step. Seriously.
1. Find your local rails meetup and bring your laptop. Ask someone to help you [setup your computer for rails-development](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html)! This is an awkward process because laptops don't come *ready* for software development. You have to install a bunch of shit and its confusing forever. This is the most important time to not be discouraged.
1. If you're willing to setup your own computer, you can [follow these instructions](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html).
