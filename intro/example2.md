# Questions

**Did anyone quit out of frustration?**
> Nobody quit out of frustration. One person was failing and decided that he could cut his losses.

**Are you from the Boulder area or did you have to find housing? If you needed housing, was it easy to find?**
> No i'm from Seattle. I left/sold everything in Seattle to move to Denver for gSchool in galvanize. I did find housing. I was introduced to another gSchool student on an email list, we got an apartment before arriving. It was easy. As long as you have savings to pay for the costs, its not hard to find a place.

**I just read that Jeff C left. Would you recommend that I apply to his new school too?**
> Yes i would recommend Jeff's new School [Turing School of Software](http://turing.io) above gSchool and devbootcamp and starter league.

> The difference is profession. gSchool/DevBootcamp/StarterLeague are ran by programmers, who's most recent job is to *program software*. Jeff@Turing's most recent job was *education and training*...

> Jeff was a middleschool teacher! Do you know how insane people are to be teachers? They're amazing human beings, because they are actually trained to deal with people that are trying to learn... people that are trying to learn are grumpy, and tired, and confused, and being a teacher means being there to mentally help you take steps to get better.

> Programmers are just people that know how to type words into a computer to make it put a fancy website on the internet. Some know how to orchestrate the words into the computer so beautifully, that they architect systems that can't be broken. Some programmers are better at helping people than other's, this is a fact which is to mean that You will learn if you go to gSchool/DevBootcamp/etc... But i'd rather learn from a teacher than a programmer. Another fact, is that you might learn better from a programmer than a teacher.
