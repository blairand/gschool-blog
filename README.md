TL;DR - This is where you'll ask some questions about gSchool / devbootcamp / Turing.io and get answers...

# F.A.Q - Frequently Asked Questions

**Did you  have any prior web development or programming knowledge?**
> Yes I had done a few online tutorials, like:
  -  half of http://www.railstutorial.org/book
  -  codecademy
  -  http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/

**Are you from the Boulder area or did you have to find housing? If you needed housing, was it easy to find?**
> No i'm from Seattle. I left/sold everything in Seattle to move to Denver for gSchool in galvanize. I did find housing. I was introduced to another gSchool student on an email list, we got an apartment before arriving. It was easy. As long as you have savings to pay for the costs, its not hard to find a place.

> Less stressful because you have more time to validate and learn what you're being taught

**What did you think of the teachers and the class environment? Was the learning primarily focused on practice or theory?**
> There is very little time for theory, practice makes perfect.

**
What did you think about the length of the program? Most programs similar to gSchool are shorter. Would you go again to a 6-month program or just an 8-12 week one? Was it overwhelming or stressful at times? Is the pace intense or moderate for most people?

> Hopefully you can see this image below, but this is *basically* what it takes to be a web developer. In other words, this is basically what is *required* to become a web developer.

> To be clear, I think the 6-month length is perfect. Shorter would be super difficult to learn things every well.
> A few people have dedicated their lives to each little blip on the map above. Its nearly impossible to get an expert level understanding of these topics in 6 months from scratch, and I cannot imagine trying to learn this in 12 weeks.
>It *is* possible to hear a bunch of words that might resemble things you understand, but if you're new to development then you're hearing hundreds of new words and concepts.

**What do you think of Ruby on Rails? Would you recommend it to someone learning a language for the first time or do you think another language such as Python would be more beneficial?**
> I think rails is a great place to start. Its got a huge community, and that means there are a lot of beginners asking the same questions, so it 100% guarantee that your question has been asked before. I cannot say the same for python or node.
> If you asked someone "Will you give me some dinner?", you'd probably get a funny response because there are a million ways to have food shoveled into your face. They might ask "what should i make?", or "do you have a recipe?", or "can i hire someone to do it?"... this is the world of software development. There are a million ways and reasons to do things, and rails follows a fairly consistent outcome. Its like following a strict cooking recipe out of a book. if you take time to read the recipe then you'd have a good outcome. Node is like hiring a hip chef. You're likely to get something good, but don't have any preconceived ideas of how it will happen.

**What did you think of your fellow students? Were they doing the program with the goal of becoming a serious programmer, picking it up as a hobby, applying the skills towards a current job?**
> The large majority was coming to become a programmer. Nobody commits this much money and time for a hobby, and only one person was a developer before coming to gSchool. Most people were college educated, in the working world, but ecstatically interested in what the web had to offer.



**Did you feel that the instructors new their content areas well?**
> Yes everyone knows the content well enough. To tell you the truth, as someone who's been out of the program for a year, i know enough about the content to teach it. the better value is that the school is ran by people that know how to teach, and people who know about the community you're trying to join.

> If you want to join startup-world as fast as possible. then a shorter program is fine. I wanted to learn as much as possible and participate in the open-source community.

**Did anyone quit out of frustration?**
> Nobody quit out of frustration. One person was failing and decided that he could cut his losses.

**Did you look at other programs such as RefactorU or DaVinci Coders? Is there a reason you chose gSchool over these ones?**
> I did look at other schools, i chose gSchool because of the instructors, length, curriculum, and job guarantee.  

**Did you find gSchool helpful in connecting you with people in the industry and ultimately landing a job?**
> Yes Jeff Casimir made it a priority that we were hired. This is one subject where I like to clarify that Jeff Casimir deserves 100% of the recognition and nothing for the "gSchool" name. gSchool is ran by Galvanize. Galvanize is ran by a bunch of super smart awesome business men that don't have enough time to care if you get a job or not... Jeff was starting a business and had no greater desire than to make his startup business succeed. After all, starting a school as a teacher is the pinnacle of success! Casimir was more than helpful in connecting us to people and getting everyone hired, and you should make sure your teachers have taught for long enough to know they're interested in experimenting with their career for a year.

**I just read that Jeff C left. Would you recommend that I apply to his new school too?**
> Yes i would recommend Jeff's new School [Turing School of Software](http://turing.io) above gSchool and devbootcamp and starter league.

> The difference is profession. gSchool/DevBootcamp/StarterLeague are ran by programmers, who's most recent job is to *program software*. Jeff@Turing's most recent job was *education and training*...

> Jeff was a middleschool teacher! Do you know how insane people are to be teachers? They're amazing human beings, because they are actually trained to deal with people that are trying to learn... people that are trying to learn are grumpy, and tired, and confused, and being a teacher means being there to mentally help you take steps to get better.

> Programmers are just people that know how to type words into a computer to make it put a fancy website on the internet. Some know how to orchestrate the words into the computer so beautifully, that they architect systems that can't be broken. Some programmers are better at helping people than other's, this is a fact which is to mean that You will learn if you go to gSchool/DevBootcamp/etc... But i'd rather learn from a teacher than a programmer. Another fact, is that you might learn better from a programmer than a teacher.

**Where do you currently work? Do you feel like gSchool gave you the necessary skills to succeed there?**
> I currently work at [Quick Left](http://www.quickleft.com) as an Engineer. Absolutely had the skills necessary to succeed. Eventually you get comfortable learning how to learn, and learning how to use the knowledge you've remembered through coding experience. One of my first projects was pairing/training with some client developers to build a product and teach rails.  The only way to be good is through experience. *Reading* and **Writing** lots of code!

**What was the most challenging part of the class?**
> I have always found comfort in knowing things, and this was an introduction into a life where you can never "know all the things". It was scary, but eventually comforting. I'm sure it will be a rollercoaster, of feeling confident in what i know, and back to confident i need to keep learning to stay fresh.
