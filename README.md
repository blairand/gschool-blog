# FAQ

>TL;DR - This is where you'll ask some questions about gSchool / devbootcamp / Turing.io and get answers...
>Please read all the questions and Answers before you send me questions. Its likely that it has already been answered.

**Did you  have any prior web development or programming knowledge?**
> Yes I had done a few online tutorials, like:
  -  half of http://www.railstutorial.org/book
  -  codecademy
  -  http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/

**Are you from the Boulder area or did you have to find housing? If you needed housing, was it easy to find?**
> No i'm from Seattle. I left/sold everything in Seattle to move to Denver for gSchool in galvanize. I found housing on craigslist with another student i was introduced to through email before we got to Denver.

**What do you think of Ruby on Rails? Would you recommend it to someone learning a language for the first time or do you think another language such as Python would be more beneficial?**
> To clarify, ruby is a language, and Rails is a tool that helps you build websites. Rails is written in ruby.
>I think ruby/rails is a great place to start. Its got a huge community and that means there are a lot of beginners asking the same questions. There are also many rails experts.  It almost guarantees that any question you have has been asked before, and answered before, and I cannot say the same for node or python.

**What did you think about the length of the program? Most programs similar to gSchool are shorter. Would you go again to a 6-month program or just an 8-12 week one? Was it overwhelming or stressful at times? Is the pace intense or moderate for most people?**

[*Long Answer*]()


>**TL;DR** 6-month length is perfect. Shorter would not give enough time to get thorough feedback on your projects. In the beginning, you can only get better by reading/writing more code. Laws of physics have proven you can do more of XYZ in 24-weeks than you can in 12 weeks. Beyond writing more code, you have twice as much time to get feedback from teachers, peers, mentors that are focused on getting you a job.

> Short-term programming schools(less than 1-year) have not been around that long, so we're currently seeing a marketplace flooded with bootcamps that are 8-weeks, 10-weeks, 12-weeks, etc. and they're still experimenting but have taken the risk mostly off themselves by

> I think the 6-month length is perfect. Shorter would be super difficult to learn things every well.
> Hopefully you can see this image below, but this is *basically* whats is required to be a web developer.

> A few people have dedicated their lives to each little blip on the map above. Its nearly impossible to get an expert level understanding of these topics in 6 months from scratch, and I cannot imagine trying to learn this in 12 weeks.
>It *is* possible to hear a bunch of words that might resemble things you understand, but if you're new to development then you're hearing hundreds of new words and concepts.

**What did you think of your fellow students? Were they doing the program with the goal of becoming a serious programmer, picking it up as a hobby, applying the skills towards a current job?**
> The large majority was coming to become a programmer. Nobody commits this much money and time for a hobby, and only one person was a developer before coming to gSchool. Most people were college educated, in the working world, but ecstatically interested in what the web had to offer.

**Did anyone quit out of frustration?**
> Nobody quit out of frustration. One person was failing and decided that he could cut his losses.

**What did you think of the teachers and the class environment? Was the learning primarily focused on practice or theory? Did you feel that the instructors new their content areas well?**
> There is very little time for "theory", practice makes perfect.

> Yes everyone knows the content well enough. To tell you the truth, as someone who's been out of the program for a year, i know enough about the content to teach it. the better value is that the school is ran by people that know how to teach, and people who know about the community you're trying to join.

> If you want to join startup-world as fast as possible. then a shorter program is fine. I wanted to learn as much as possible and participate in the open-source community.

**Did you look at other programs such as RefactorU or DaVinci Coders? Is there a reason you chose gSchool over these ones?**
> I did look at other schools, i chose gSchool because of the instructors, length, curriculum, and job guarantee.  

**Did you find gSchool helpful in connecting you with people in the industry and ultimately landing a job?**
> Yes Jeff Casimir made it a priority that we were hired. This is one subject where I like to clarify that Jeff Casimir deserves 100% of the recognition and nothing for the "gSchool" name. gSchool is ran by Galvanize. Galvanize is ran by a bunch of super smart awesome business men that don't have enough time to care if you get a job or not... Jeff was starting a business and had no greater desire than to make his startup business succeed. After all, starting a school as a teacher is the pinnacle of success! Casimir was more than helpful in connecting us to people and getting everyone hired, and you should make sure your teachers have taught for long enough to know they're interested in experimenting with their career for a year.

**I just read that Jeff C left gSchool. Would you recommend that I apply to his new school too?**
> Yes i would recommend Jeff's new School Turing School of Software.

> The difference is profession. gSchool/DevBootcamp/StarterLeague are ran by programmers, who's most recent job is to *program software*. Jeff@Turing's most recent job was *education and training*...

> Jeff was a middleschool teacher! Do you know how insane people are to be teachers? They're amazing human beings, because they are actually trained to deal with people that are trying to learn... people that are trying to learn are grumpy, and tired, and confused, and being a teacher means being there to mentally help you take steps to get better.

> Programmers are just people that know how to type words into a computer to make it put a fancy website on the internet. Some know how to orchestrate the words into the computer so beautifully, that they architect systems that can't be broken. Some programmers are better at helping people than other's, this is a fact which is to mean that You will learn if you go to gSchool/DevBootcamp/etc... But i'd rather learn from a teacher than a programmer. Another fact, is that you might learn better from a programmer than a teacher.

**Where do you currently work? Do you feel like gSchool gave you the necessary skills to succeed there?**
> I currently work at [Quick Left](http://www.quickleft.com) as an Engineer. Absolutely had the skills necessary to succeed. Eventually you get comfortable learning how to learn, and learning how to use the knowledge you've remembered through coding experience. One of my first projects was training some client developers about rails while building a web app for them.  The only way to be good is through experience. The only way to get experience is *Reading* and *Writing* **code!**

**What was the most challenging part of the class?**
> I have always found comfort in knowledge, and the life of a software developer is one where you can never know all the things. Somewhere in the middle of class you wake up and realize you cannot actually learn EVERYTHING about programming and a weight lifts off your shoulders. The next hardest part is getting a job. A couple people in each class are fairly quick to get jobs, which adds pressure, then you realize you have to start telling people you're a software developer and its scary. But then you get a job and they love you.
