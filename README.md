# FAQ

>TL;DR - Please read all the questions and Answers before you send me questions. But I'm happy to add more answers

**Did you  have any prior web development or programming knowledge?**
> Yes I had done a few online tutorials, like:
  -  half of http://www.railstutorial.org/book
  -  codecademy
  -  http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/

**Are you from the Boulder/Denver/SF area or did you have to find housing? If you needed housing, was it easy to find?**
> I'm from Seattle. I left/sold everything I owned to move to Denver for the first gSchool in the first galvanize. I found housing on craigslist with another gSchool student. There was a brief period of time after getting accepted/before starting where we were introduced through email.

**What do you think of Ruby on Rails? Would you recommend it to someone learning a language for the first time or do you think another language such as Python would be more beneficial?**
> To clarify, **Ruby** is a language and **Rails** is a tool that helps you build websites. Rails is written in ruby. Its literally a bunch of ruby files organized together to make it so you don't have to write as much code to have a cool website.
> I think ruby/rails is a great place to start. Its got a huge/happy community and that means there are a lot of beginners asking the same questions. There are also many rails experts.  It basically guarantees that any question you have has been asked/answered before and I cannot say the same for node or python.

**What did you think about the length of the program? Most programs similar to gSchool are shorter. Would you go again to a 6-month program or just an 8-12 week one? Was it overwhelming or stressful at times? Is the pace intense or moderate for most people?**

> 5-7-months is perfect. Shorter would not be enough time for thorough feedback. You can only get better by reading/writing more code and obviously you can do more in 24-weeks than you can in 12 weeks. Beyond writing more code you have twice as much time to get feedback from teachers, peers, mentors that are genuinely interested in helping educate you. Hopefully you can see this image below, but this is *basically* whats is required to be a web developer.

> A few people have dedicated their lives to each blip on the map above and its nearly impossible to get an expert level understanding of these topics in less than a year. I cannot imagine trying to learn all of this in 12 weeks but its necessary to get most web applications up and running...

**What did you think of your fellow students? Were they doing the program with the goal of becoming a serious programmer, picking it up as a hobby, applying the skills towards a current job?**
> The large majority was coming to become a programmer. Nobody commits this much money/time for a hobby, and only a couple people had done development before coming to gSchool. Most people were college educated, in the working world, but ecstatically interested in what the web had to offer.

**Did anyone quit out of frustration?**
> One person was failing and decided that he could cut his losses and drop out. He was probably frustrated.

**What did you think of the teachers and the class environment? Was the learning primarily focused on practice or theory?**
> There is very little time for "theory", practice makes perfect. Its kinda like asking a plumber if they know about being an architect. Or asking an electrician if they know about interior design. Programming is like cooking. You need a dinner and there are millions of recipes for you to follow. You can also cook without a recipe. Usually to make something fantastic you've followed the recipe a bunch of times that you know when to stray from the recipe. You have ingredients, in programming these are libraries. In programming you put a bunch of libraries together and pull out a fancy website. Sometimes you make your own library in the same way you might grow your own tomatoes.  

**Did you feel that the instructors new their content areas well?**
> Yes everyone knows the content well enough. To tell you the truth, as someone who's been out since July2013, I know enough about the content to teach it. The better value is that the school is ran by people who know about the community you're trying to join.  

**Did you look at other programs such as RefactorU or DaVinci Coders? Is there a reason you chose gSchool over these ones?**
> I did look at other schools, I chose gSchool because of the instructors, length, curriculum, and job guarantee.  

**Did you find gSchool helpful in connecting you with people in the industry and ultimately landing a job?**
> Yes, my main instructor was Jeff Casimir and he made it a priority that we were hired. Still to this day I can reach out to him or the gSchool team for contacts about getting hired. They're constantly talking to companies that are becoming more and more likely to hire 'bootcamp' students.


**I read that Jeff left gSchool. Would you recommend that I apply to his new school too?**
> Yes I would recommend Jeff's new School Turing School of Software. I'd also recommend gSchool. You should probably apply to both.


**Do you feel like gSchool gave you the necessary skills to succeed there?**
> I currently work at as an Engineer. You should look at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersonblair/). Absolutely had the skills necessary to succeed. Eventually you get comfortable learning how to learn, and learning how to use the knowledge you've remembered through coding experience. One of my first projects was training some client developers about rails while building a web app for them.  The only way to be good is through experience. The only way to get experience is *Reading* and *Writing* **code!**

**What was the most challenging part of the class?**
> I have always found comfort in knowledge, and the life of a software developer is one where you can never know all the things. Somewhere in the middle of class you wake up and realize you cannot actually learn EVERYTHING about programming and a weight lifts off your shoulders. The next hardest part is getting a job. A couple people in each class are fairly quick to get jobs, which adds pressure, then you realize you have to start telling people you're a software developer and its scary. But then you get a job and they love you.
