# F.A.Q - Frequently Asked Questions

**Did you  have any prior web development or programming knowledge?**
> Yes I had done a few online tutorials, like:
  -  codecademy
  -  http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/
  -  half of http://www.railstutorial.org/book

**Many of the programs are 12 weeks and intense. Is the 6 month program  stressful? Is the pace intense or moderate for most people?**
> Less stressful because you have more time to validate and learn what you're being taught

**Did you feel that the instructors new their content areas well?**
> Yes everyone knows the content well enough. To tell you the truth, as someone who's been out of the program for a year, i know enough about the content to teach it. the better value is that the school is ran by people that know how to teach, and people who know about the community you're trying to join.

> If you want to join startup-world as fast as possible. then a shorter program is fine. I wanted to learn as much as possible and participate in the open-source community.

**What was the most challenging part of the class?**
> I have always found comfort in knowing things, and this was an introduction into a life where you can never "know all the things". It was scary, but eventually comforting. I'm sure it will be a rollercoaster, of feeling confident in what i know, and back to confident i need to keep learning to stay fresh.

**Did anyone quit out of frustration?**
> Nobody quit out of frustration. One person was failing and decided that he could cut his losses.

**Are you from the Boulder area or did you have to find housing? If you needed housing, was it easy to find?**
> No i'm from Seattle. I left/sold everything in Seattle to move to Denver for gSchool in galvanize. I did find housing. I was introduced to another gSchool student on an email list, we got an apartment before arriving. It was easy. As long as you have savings to pay for the costs, its not hard to find a place.

**I just read that Jeff C left. Would you recommend that I apply to his new school too?**
> Yes i would recommend Jeff's new School [Turing School of Software](http://turing.io) above gSchool and devbootcamp and starter league.

> The difference is profession. gSchool/DevBootcamp/StarterLeague are ran by programmers, who's most recent job is to *program software*. Jeff@Turing's most recent job was *education and training*...

> Jeff was a middleschool teacher! Do you know how insane people are to be teachers? They're amazing human beings, because they are actually trained to deal with people that are trying to learn... people that are trying to learn are grumpy, and tired, and confused, and being a teacher means being there to mentally help you take steps to get better.

> Programmers are just people that know how to type words into a computer to make it put a fancy website on the internet. Some know how to orchestrate the words into the computer so beautifully, that they architect systems that can't be broken. Some programmers are better at helping people than other's, this is a fact which is to mean that You will learn if you go to gSchool/DevBootcamp/etc... But i'd rather learn from a teacher than a programmer. Another fact, is that you might learn better from a programmer than a teacher.
