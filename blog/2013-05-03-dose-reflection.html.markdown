- __DoSE - Yesterday’s projects seemed much stronger than the last round. What changes did you make to your process or expectations? What would you do if, just hypothetically, you were going to continue working on the project another two weeks.__

The main change was that I switched from not doing any TDD, into doing mostly TDD. For the most part i’ve been converted into a believer of tests. I wish i could conquer controller testing but i feel very strongly about model tests and what i can achieve with them. it greatly helped me re-write my code to focus on changeability in the future.  

- __APIs - Next week we’ll start both consuming and producing APIs. What sounds interesting, difficult, or exciting about building applications that talk to other applications?__

The internet has constructed a few languages that are basically universal. They allow us to build apps and content that can be consumed by other people. Recently developers have been promoting their APIs so that other developers can consume their apps and content. I love the idea that most of the content for big applications is available through APIs and i’m excited to begin to build my own.  

- __Last week you wrote about your strengths and weaknesses with Rails specifically. Were you able to address any of those weaknesses this week?__

Yes i did. Testing is still my main weakness. Like most things, ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’ could hold more true. I ended up thinking i was writing good tests, only to see the application break while the tests did not fail. It forced me to re-write them after getting a better understanding of the situation. 

- __As we start to shift more attention to what happens after the course, what do you think you want to do?__

I want to program with/near/around a good mentor. I don’t necessarily need to be in any specific industry, but i would like to be building things, breaking things, and understanding the internet better. It seems like the future is involved with ruby, rails, and javascript frameworks. After the course I’d like to be in an environment where I can continue to learn these types of things.
