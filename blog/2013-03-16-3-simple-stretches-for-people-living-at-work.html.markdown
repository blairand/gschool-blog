These are the most basic workouts that will keep you healthy while working at a desk. 

###Bird Dog

</div>
####__To perform the exercise, you'll need to get on all fours. Then lift your right arm and left leg simultaneously and extend them until they are parallel with the ground.  Hold this position for 7 to 8 seconds.  Finally, lower your hand and knee, gently sweep the ground, and raise them again for another repetition.  Switch sides after four to five repetitions and repeat.__


###Curl Up

</div>

####__To perform the exercise, lay flat on your back with your left leg bent, and your right leg straight. Then place your hand underneath the small of your back such that they fill in the gap created by the curve of your spine. Begin by lifting your head and upper shoulders off of the floor. Hold yourself in this elevated position for 7 to 8 seconds, while continuing to breathe. Finally, return your shoulders to the ground. Repeat the exercises four to five times, switch your legs, and then repeat another four to five times. If you need to increase the difficulty, try lifting your elbows off the ground with your shoulders.__

###Side Bridge

</div>
####__To perform the side bridge, lay on your side and prop your body up with your elbow and knees.  Hold this position for 7 to 8 seconds while continuing to breathe and repeat four to five times for each side. You should not try to increase the difficulty by increasing the duration of the exercise. Instead, increase the number of repetitions as necessary.__
