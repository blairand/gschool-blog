__What’s the over-arching message of The Passionate Programmer?__

As I was reading the passionate programmer, i highlighted all the _'act on it'_ sections and also things that resonated well in my brain. This quote below from is from the book, and it is a very clear and succinct description that i'll be able to take with my on my journey towards continuous growth:  

> _The process in this book is a loop that repeats until you retire. Research, Invest, Execute, Market, Repeat. Spending too much time inside any iteration of the loop puts you at risk of becoming suddenly obsolete._

- __Research:__ Researching is about becoming the master of your domain, wherever you're situated, you should become the person that people ask for help.
  
- __Invest:__ Investing is not about money, its about time. Spend time learning new technologies and building relationships with people that will help you. Spend time helping others and you'll be rewarded. 

- __Execute:__ Execution is __#1__ most important because nothing else matters if you can't genuinely add value to a team/project/business. You need to be able to consume the research, invest in yourself, and then execute on what you've learned. 
  
- __Market:__ There is a reason why [some companies](http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131249&page=1) spend more to publicize their good deeds than they spend on the good deeds themselves. Marketing is how we show _proof_ of our research, time-investments, and product-execution. As we learn and understand technologies, we should post small essays and comments on our blog. We should add our projects to a portfolio page. We should prove that we can walk the walk…

- __Repeat:__ keep going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and going...


__What lessons from the book can you apply to your work in our program?__

In a small way, all of the above lessons can be applied to [gSchool](http://www.gschool.it). 

- I can be the person with the answers. 
- I can spend time learning about new technologies and how they relate to what we're learning in class. 
- I can write high-quality code, and not settle for less. 
- I can show the code to people when they have questions. 
- I can keep my blog updated with interesting things I read on the internet, and interesting projects that we complete. 
- I can find a mentor and use them to become the best.
