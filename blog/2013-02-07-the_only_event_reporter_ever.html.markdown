Today we submitted our code for the [event_reporter][1] and I am happy with some parts of my product but also dissapointed with other partsâ€¦

_Basic Introduction_

The problem was to create a Command Line Interface for a csv parser. It is supposed to accept a file for input or load a default file. Then after it should parse and clean the data, then allow for searching against some fields, print them to screen and then save to a file. 

### Personal RetroSpective

_Recap of Work Day_

The first work day for me was really long because I allowed the stress of the proejct to consume my brain.  Jeff was out sick and he didn't give Steve much direction so we all went our separate ways and started to work. A few of us stayed at galvanize until midnight and didn't feel much fatigue because i was eating properly and using pomodoros. We were all working together and separately in different patterns. 

I am most productive on a regular schedule; breakfast in the morning, lunch mid-day, dinner at night with some coding before bed. When i get into a project it is hard to sleep from the mixture of stress and excitment. My mind wants to work constantly and i need to practice fighting that and staying on a regular pattern. 

I am happy with the speed that I completed the basic expectations and that I could turn my project into a (partially)working [GEM][2].  I was helping quite a few people with hashes and Structs, which ended up being self serving because I could confirm my knowledge about the topic and read lots of code :)

I am most dissappointed with myself for skipping testing.  I should have turned the base expectations into specs, and built out unit tests from the beginning. I think the group as a whole would have benefited from an rspec session instead of a debugging session. In the end, it was clear that my process was completely innefficient.
