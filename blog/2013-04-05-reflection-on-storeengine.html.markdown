- __What did you learn about Rails during StoreEngine? How does that shape your plan for the next project?__

I learned that rails is what you make it. Building a website can be like finding your way through a maze, or it can be like taking a guided tour. The more you pre-plan, the better your project will become. In all future projects I will read the documentation before asking questions. The rails guides are more helpful than any single person.  

- __What did you learn about working in a larger team during StoreEngine? What things will you do the same or different during the next project?__

The project can only be as good as the team. If you don’t respect your teammates, or don’t enjoy their company then you won’t create a great product.  For future projects, i’d like to clarify upfront if people want to achieve personal goals, to get a feel for stories and features they can build to align with those goals. Other than that, we worked through the happy path and didn’t build things until we needed them(YAGNI). I had a great time with the team. 

- __Do you feel like your team was 50-100% more productive than a two-person team? How does that inform your thinking about the way teams are constructed?__

Yes we were, its obvious to me that pair programming is the shit. maybe this is only true when all people like pairing, but i enjoyed it.  I wish we were able to have a tiny bit of insight on group selection. Maybe allow the winning team to stay together??
