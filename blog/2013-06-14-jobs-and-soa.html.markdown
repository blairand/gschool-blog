###Services Project

- __How’s it feel to be back in a group? Did you learn any lessons working on your own that you’re now bringing through the group?__

I’m having fun and really excited to be working with people again. I learned that i’d really like to be pairing at a future job. 

- __Have you dug into using websockets with Faye? How has it gone so far?__

It has been fun. I haven’t dug into the inner-workings of faye but playing around with the gem has been fun and interesting. 
Job Hunt

- __How’s the job hunt going? Have you applied for jobs? Interviewed? Any lessons learned?__

The job hunt is going well. I have applied/interviewed/scheduled -future-interviews and i’m pretty happy with the feedback that i’m getting. So far it seems that every company is admittedly treating us differently because they have no clue what we’re capable of but still it is all very exciting.

- __What are your next steps to finding a great job?__

Continue talking to companies and continue interviewing. It seems like some people are waiting for something, but I have been fairly aggressive with my intentions to apply and interview and i’ve been fairly successful getting in the door. 

- __What things have you observed, from shadowing or guest speakers, that appeal to you about companies? What things have turned you off?__

It has been interesting to hear some people say that #1 priority is the company culture, where earlier stage companies seem to hold the mission/passion at top. It is interesting but i’m not passing on any companies prematurely. I’m keeping myself busy with phone interviews and technical interviews and waiting for an offer or two :)
