__Since writing my previous post, many things have changed in my life. __

* I applied and was accepted to [gSchool - ruby and rails training]("http://www.gschool.it")
* Quit my job
* Broke up with my girlfriend
* Stopped drinking Alcohol, Coffee, and Soda
* Got rid of all my belongings except for a single car-load
* Shot my [first handgun](http://youtu.be/fbo25NXAmV8)Â :)
* Drove 1,371 miles moving from Seattle to Denver...


The most important was being accepted into gSchool. Without any hesitation, I knew the other events simply needed to take place to satisfy the first...
