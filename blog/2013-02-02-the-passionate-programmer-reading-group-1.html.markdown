__Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?__

Tip 8 "Be a Specialist" is something I naturally started to do in my in my previous career in sales and operations. Since the beginning of time, my industry(wholesale/retail) has had a centralized power structure with the largest retailers at the top. Amazon.com came to market and said up-front their model would be decentralized. They created a self-service platform and basically for the first time, every manufacturer could compete on a level playing field. 

Amazon's decentralized approach was new to the industry and mostly still is new to the industry. They created self-service tools for manufacturers and it was my goal to become the specialist. I knew that no amount of experience in the industry could help because Amazon and ecommerce merchants play an entirely different game than regular retailers. This gave me an opportunity to be successful without needing multiple years of experience. 

It is similar to programming because languages and technologies are continuously evolving and emerging. This creates a cycle that allows people to become valuable and provide value back to the community.
