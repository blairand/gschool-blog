- __We’re about 1/3 of the way through the course. Are you a developer yet? How/why? What’s meeting, exceeding, or falling short of your expectations?__

We just completed the introduction to rails and i’m still very positive about the process and the knowledge i've gained. Trial and error is better than any book because it really cements the things you understand quickly lets you find points of confusion. I think Jeff and gSchool have done a great job of using ruby to intro the good ruby practices that are normal practices in rails. 

- __What do you think about Rails so far? There’s a tradeoff between doing everything yourself with Sinatra versus the on-the-surface simplicity of Rails. Which makes you more comfortable? Which do you think is more productive in the short-term? Long-term?__

I am really liking rails. things that you would consistently do in a sinatra application are built into rails and done properly. I’m comfortable knowing that rails works, and i feel one thing that will make me stronger is understanding routing. 

In the long term i’ll definitely be more productive with rails. It creates another level of abstraction where the most you need to know how to solve a problem is installing a gem and wiring it into your application. This is very similiar to wordpress users implementing plugins and widgets except you get completely custom solutions, and you pick and choose your implementation details.

- __If you could schedule one guest speaker to talk with the class, who would it be and why?__

If Jeff could schedule one guest speaker, I would request Ara T. Howard. After listening to his episode on ruby rogues, I gained a new respect for ruby. He busts the myth ‘ruby can’t scale’ using his projects as examples. Maybe we could take a field trip to boulder on a wednesday morning and hear him talk?(<http://rubyrogues.com/094-rr-robust-ruby-with-ara-t-howard/>)
