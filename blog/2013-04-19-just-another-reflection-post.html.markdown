- __Son of Store Engine – what went right? What went wrong? Why? What things will you do the same on your next project and what will you do differently?__

I think the group culture went right. I made sure everyone felt comfortable talking, and that everyone felt like they were expected to talk and join in the decision-making opposed to being told what to do. I regret not setting a high standard for code quality at the beginning. I allowed everyone to be a collaborator on the project instead of requiring them to fork and submit pull requests. This made it so that people were pushing, without knowing whether their code would merge cleanly. unfortunately for my future project partners, i’ll be more of a stickler for code quality and testing. Hopefully my team is down with that. 

- __Organization – how are you keeping track of what you need to do on a given day? How do you decide to divide time between project work, reading, lightning talks, and personal learning?__

I don’t know how i’m keeping track. I try to read for at least one pomodoro per day, and then i align personal learning with project work so that i’m building things i’m interested in. I do a fairly good job at it, but i tend to push all my reading to saturdays and sunday, which isn’t very smart.  

- __Halfway – As of today we’re halfway done. How does that make you feel? What do you think the next three months will be like? Do you feel like your momentum is building or slowing? What can you do to affect your outcomes in July?__

Halfway done feels great, because i’ve learned a shitload and if my pace continues then I’ll do well in July, It seems like SonOfStoreEngine put a damper on everyone’s mood, but i just saw it as another lesson-learned and opportunity for growth. I figured people would quit the program after yesterday, and wish that the instructors held our feet to the fire a bit more. it seems in each group there are producers and people that are catching up. I think at some point there should be some separation around capabilities.
