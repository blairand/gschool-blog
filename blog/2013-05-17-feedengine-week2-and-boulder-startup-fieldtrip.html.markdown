#### FeedEngine

- __What have been the tough parts so far?__

We have been working through the pain in pairs and getting pretty far. The tough parts have been making the creative decisions that go into making a site look good. Its lots of fun but still challenging. 


- __What’s the plan for the next six days?__

We're going to keep working on stories, we're going to keep our code quality high. 

We're going to POODR :)

- __What is it going to be like when you finish?__

Its going to be bittersweet. This is one of my favorite projects so far because the people in the team are awesome and the problem is fun and open-ended. 


#### Boulder Startup Week

- __What did you learn yesterday?__

I learned that we're being properly trained to be welcomed into the ruby community. Many companies have a sour taste in their mouth after interviewing students from other 'bootcamp' style training, but our training is much more comprehensive. Every time a company says "We're looking for X and Y and a little bit of Z…" its always been the case that we are being specifically preparing for those things. 

- __Did it give you any better sense of what you want to do after our class? Why/what/how?__

I would like to working at a good consulting company. If i have to be an apprentice for a month or two, I wouldn't mind. You get a different feeling after walking into a company that takes pride in their work. I want to be somewhere like that. I want to be at a company that places their employees happiness at #2 priority below being profitable. 

- __Did it give you any new perspective on how you’re going to attack our last weeks?__

My perspective has not changed. I plan to prepare ahead of time so I can spend some time actively meeting companies and asking 2 questions:

1. What would it take to work here?

2. If you don't have openings, can you recommend some companies that are hiring?
