_It’s important to look back and assess what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong, celebrate victories, and analyze defeats._


__SalesEngine__

__What’s a technique that you’ve used in the project that was once totally opaque but now is clear?__ 

I did not know the difference between class methods and instance methods prior to this project. It seemed like "sometimes X works and sometimes Y works but I can't tell when". Then a light turned on and I started to understand that some are sent to the whole class, and some are sent to a specific instance. 

__What’s something that’s still confusing to you? Why?__

I’m very much in the mindset of ‘I don’t know what I don’t know’. I feel the knowledge i’ve consumed has settled in, but not at a level where i’d like.  This morning with SalesEngine(before we realized it was friday) a couple tests failed and the code isn’t very complex. either the test is bad or the code is bad. 

I’m still confused with testing, I know how to create a basic test, but I cannot use it to drive developing code.

__How do you feel about testing with MiniTest? What about it makes your process harder? Easier?__

Testing with minitest is fine. I have the same level of experience with rspec and i’d be happy to use either at any moment. My problem is using tests to drive development. I’m not in the mindset of ‘dream driven development’ yet. It makes the overall process easier because we’re more confident with each passing test. 

__Is working in a pair harder or easier than being by yourself? Do you feel like you’d be farther ahead or behind if you were on your own? Can nine women make a baby in one month?__

Working in a pair is not harder or easier, its just different. I think that I would be further ahead, but in reality i think it would be minimal. Having another set of eyes to catch typos is probably the most valuable part of pairing. I know that if my pair had a similar skill level to mine then we would be burning through the project.  if I were working on my own I would still have to struggle through the same learning points of the project but not have to re-explain things.

Nine women cannot make a baby in one month.
