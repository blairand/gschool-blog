__Individual Project__

- __Now that you’ve been working on your own for a week, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it’d be super hard, was it? If you thought you’d move incredibly quickly, did you?__

Working on my own has been met my expectations. I have a preference to work with people, working alone proves it. I'm not in pure misery, but i notice myself getting side-tracked on small things, opposed to writing clear milestones and sticking to them. I know how ot fix the problem, so i'm going to try and do that for the rest of the project and see how well it works. 

- __Given that you’ve defined an MVP and are almost halfway through, do you feel like you’ve gotten half of the work done? If not, do you expect progress to speed up? Why?__

Yes i do feel that i've got half the work done. My app works almost completely, i would like to try out grape or rails-api to create a better public interface. I was attempting to build article revisions into the application and its proving more difficult than expected. I have also started the rubygem and got it to post an article. WooHoo.  


- __Working on your own, do you feel like you’re spending more time stuck on problems or are you more likely to ask for help?__

My methods for getting unstuck have not really changed. The first step is realizing you have a problem(See where i'm going with this?). After i see a problem, i take a 5-minute break and come back to break down the problem to its single painpoint. If I change the message(on a test) then i reset and continue as normal. If I cannot change the message on a test for an entire pomodoro, then I ask for help. 

__The Future__

- __It’s seven weeks until we’re finished. What do you intend to focus on during that time? Why is that the most important thing?__

I would like to focus on javascript because its fairly important for internet builders. Beyond that, i'd like to cleanup my resume, my portfolio website, and try to read more about CS basics.  


- __During this last phase of the class, you’re taking on more and more responsibility for your own learning, development, and future. What people, knowledge, and resources are you cultivating to continue your growth?__

I need to work on this. I would like to have a better connection with people for future development growth and conversations. knowledge and resources will forever be changing on the internet. 

- __Coming into the program you had an idea of what success looked like. Is it within reach? Or has your goal changed along the way?__

My goal for success was to get a job at a company where I would continue to grow. I know that 6-months is not much time to learn a language(or 5 of them) and I do believe the goal is in sight. It has not changed.
