Thus far, gSchool has been amazing. [Charles Max Wood](http://www.twitter.com/cmaxw)(from [ruby rogues](http://www.rubyrogues.com)) asked me “[How is gschool?](https://twitter.com/cmaxw/status/307506149639471104)” and I couldn’t fit my response into 140 characters so i’ll be sure to send him this blog post.


One month in and i’m feeling great. On 1 to 10 scale of confidence/happiness, i’m at 9.  The learning experience is exactly what I expected it to be; completely immersed in ruby dev culture and challenged with problems that are geared to teach specific skills.


In the first week as we were getting to know each-other, everyone was generally friendly. The progression of new projects helps peel back a layer of our personalities. We see panic, we see frustration, but most important is that we see happiness through solving problems(with ruby). 

>Projects don’t fail because of technology, they fail because of people. 

Beyond our ruby learning, our people skills are being challenged. Each project brings problems that neither person has solved before, and it seems that problem solving is the absolute best way to get to know a person. because of differing personalities and skill-sets, the relationships are evolving. I think it will continue organically for the next few months and friendships will grow stronger with some than with others. Each day we’re better understanding how important it is to have people skills.
