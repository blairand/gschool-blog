###Thoughts and SalesEngine

Yesterday was our _Demo Day_ for [SalesEngine](https://github.com/blairand/sales_engine). We were graded on our effort, correctness, test coverage, and style. I was most surprised that the final result was not the project I would have imagined creating. I had a lot of code duplication, and i wish i had accounted for dynamic input. Currently the project would break if the csv’s changed or were loaded in a different order. 


I was also surprised at how much fun i was having. In my previous life i was eager to leave the office at 5pm on the dot. With SalesEngine it was hard for me to leave because I continually wanted to attack pivot tracker stories. I worked most nights until 9pm and then about 20 hours on the weekend. I’d say most of them were valuable but i did notice how much more happy and active i am when i get to eat well and exercise. My goal for the next 2 weeks is to work out in the morning before class. This will be a huge change for me because I rarely get up before 7:30. Also i think most work after 9pm was worthless when i was alone. The only reason i was successful after 9pm was when other groups were around talking and helping each-other out. 

If I was going to start the project again, I would have removed duplication from the beginning. We didn’t utilize modules and ended up writing the same method for each class that could have been shared between all the code. I would have taken the instructor code and used it from the beginning. 


I’m really excited about shifting from command line interfaces into web projects. Its way more interesting to me because billions of people use the web. I want to build things that help people become smart, health, and empowered. Its hard to do that on the command line. More important than just building things, but learning how to optimize them is really when interests me. I have no fear of the full stack, probably because i don’t understand it. 

My favorite thing about class is the people. The instructors, the classmates, the mentors, the guest speakers, the people that i get to help and the people that help me.
