- __FeedEngine - What are you building? Does it feel like it could be a legit product that people want to use?__

My group is building a command center for developers to track proejcts. A developer joins the site with github, then they add projects to start being tracked.

After authentication, we start to track all the git notifications, all the project management notifcations(from pivotal tracker), and notifications for test builds from Travis-CI. 

Currently as planned, its an aggregator of notifications designed to look good on a TV. I think it will be valuable if we try to create some useful metrics about the data being aggregated. 

- __Teamwork - You’ve been through the project wringer a few times now. What strategies are you using to help your team work effectively? How are they going so far? Is there anything different about how you approach a three-week team versus a two-week team?__

We're splitting into teams of two and trusting that the other group will be productive and make smart programming decisions. We all want to produce good code, so we're coming together to make big decisions, and working through the small decisions as pairs. So far its working, but we've only had a couple real work days. The difference is that we don't feel rushed, and we get more time to experiment with technologies before implementing them. This is opposed to experimenting while implementing and later realizing you're improperly testing or building it wrong. 


- __Jobs - If you’re looking for a job after gSchool, what are some of the attributes that are most important to you about a company / position / team? How will you know when you’ve found the right fit?__

I'm really interested in being in an environment where i'm learning. I don't necessarily care whether its a consulting company or a product company at any stage. I just want to be somewhere surrounded by smart people where i can learn more, through a good mentoring system, challenging problems, or pair programming.
