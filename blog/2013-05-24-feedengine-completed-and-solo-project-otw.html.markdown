__FeedEngine__

- __Were you happy with your final product?__

I am happy with my final product, its a decent solution and implementation for the problem we were given. I was also very happy working with my team. We had good discussions about code and learned from eachother.

- __No application is perfect, but did it adequately represent your team’s three weeks of work?__

Yes. We were all learning about APIs, we made sure to prevent pain from losing responses from the api or getting incomplete data. 


- __What parts were harder than expected? Easier?__

The hardest part was realizing that you must make your application so that it will survive if the external services are down. 

- __How did it deepen or change your opinions on APIs?__

I am likely to be more careful about how i use them. 

- __Given that experience and Chris’ talk today, what ideas will influence your design of your own APIs in the future?__

It basically comes down to using the API as a way to provide documentation to the user. So that with each call they make to your service, you're returning the response and some other actions they can take. 


__Independent Project__

- __What general domain are you thinking about?__

I'm thinking about APIs and Ember. Hopefully building a simple rails API with one application and consuming that application with an ember app. I want to get more experience building APIs and API wrapper Gems. Then it would be fun to play around with a Javascript framework to consume the api. I have no clue how i'll do all this.

- __What external data or services will you make use of?__

hopefully none. I want to make my own external data-service. 

- __What problems or limitations do you think you’ll run into?__

I think i'll have plenty of problems building a complete gem for our blogger application.
