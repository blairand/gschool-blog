I had fun with [TrafficSpy](http://trafficspy.herokuapp.com). Working with [Jorge](http://twitter.com/novohispano) was entertaining and educational. Contribution was fairly equal, when one of us was writing code the other would keep the project in sight. I tended to write the complex methods and jorge would save the day with a refactor.  

We utilized SinatraRB, it was great and i’ll definitely be using it again. I think the world needs a sinatra esque version of http://railsapps.github.com/. Sequel was a great bridge to make it so i didn’t need to learn SQL. I think i’ll have to learn SQL eventually, but this was great. I think it would have been great to experience ActiveRecord instead of sequel on this project, but that might have made it too easy. 

The only thing that delayed our programming was postgres and testing. Its clear that we should make a program DB agnostic, but we got the wrong goal stuck in our minds. The programming was a great solidifier of things we learned in SalesEngine, the real learning curve for this project was learning sequel and sinatra.

The one thing that stuck with me is the fact that if you plan for disaster you’ll be ready for disaster. secretly plan a few disasters, make sure you (and your team) have accounted for all of it. 
>Amazon gives tools to plan for disaster, use them correctly.


I learned that you can’t be successful unless you speak with your customers. Really understand how they’re using your product in their toolset. 

I would definitely go all-in, 12 hours a day, and 7 days a week for politics... [@J3](http://www.twitter.com/j3) if you’re running for office let me know.


__Big Picture__

I’m feeling relatively comfortable with databases but it will be great to start playing with ORMs!!! WOO. I’m mostly happy that i’m having fun everyday, no matter what the project is we have been working through i’ve been having lots of fun. 

It does seem that formalized project management among groups has been lax, it will straighten out when our projects get more complex. I think someone in each group will need to identify themselves as the project manager, the quarterback.
