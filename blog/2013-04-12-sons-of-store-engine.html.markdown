- __Required: Who’s your mentor, where do they work, what do they do, and what have you done with them so far? How are they affecting your workflow? What value do you think they’ll bring to your learning experience?__

My mentor is David Dollar. He was an early employee at Heroku  which lead him into his current position as a floating engineer that moves to different projects as they need help. After viewing his github, it was slightly intimidating because he has created many tools that hundreds or thousands of people use on a daily basis. So far we have talked about the heroku culture and ideas about starting a career in software development. We have not gotten into gritty details or code review but i’m excited for that once i get into caching and [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)/[queue_classic](http://railscasts.com/episodes/344-queue-classic?view=comments#comment_157621). I think David will be a great source of knowledge, because he has years of experience with tools that i’m just beginning to learn about for creating robust systems. 

- __What’s different about the larger project group? Have your communication tools (Tracker/Flowdock/Github) been more useful or just more confusing?__

The difference is that you really can’t see how every piece of the puzzle is constructed and that is a fact that needs to be accepted. We’re in the class to learn, so we have a desire to see everything but its not really possible to have 4 people sitting around a computer. Tracker is decent, but if i was writing the stories with our customers, they would have been worded differently. Flowdock is great, its a simple chat platform, we use it often. Github is great for what it does, but GIT is still a large challenge for most people in the class. I would love for the [pro-git](http://git-scm.com/book) book to be required reading. or some other way to practice git while we’re learning about it, or maybe some flashcards so that we remember how to git reset --HARD upstream feature_branch?

- __What’s it like working on a "legacy" project? What were the hardest parts about getting started? Do you feel like you understand the existing project yet?__

The hardest part was deciding when/how to refactor broken code. Its been fun but annoying. Often i had done a more simple implementation but didn’t port over because it wasn’t worth the refactor.
