- __What have you chosen to do differently for this iteration of the project?__

For this iteration of the project, i’m taking time for TDD and building solid code. For the previous iteration, I was under the impression that we had to finish all the tasks. This led to a weak codebase, because we stretched our efforts too thinly.  

- __What are some of the challenges working with yet another existing codebase?__

I am fortunate to bring my previous project into this current one. At the beginning i gave a complete brain dump of the weaknesses i was aware of, and we created a mammoth issue list and started chopping away at it. for the first few days we focused solely on bugs and making sure the app worked proper.

- __What are some of the differences working more closely with a client in developing features?  Do you find you prefer a more agile approach or a waterfall approach? why?__

I like this approach a bit more than waterfall because it gives me an opportunity to sell an idea or implementation. When the rules are strictly written, it doesn’t allow much flexibility or creativity. 

- __What are areas within the Rails stack do you feel you have strong understanding? What areas do you feel you have weak understanding? How are you leveraging/improving these skills in your current project?__

I’m starting to understand how to use most of the things but I have not gained an understanding of how they’re implemented into rails. For example, ActiveRecord allows you me to create relationships and use dynamic finders, but i wouldn’t be able to recreate this myself. I can get the routes to work how i want them. I can create class methods and instance methods on models. I can create classes to decouple domain logic. I still can’t always figure how to integrate 3rd party APIs in the way i expect them to work.
