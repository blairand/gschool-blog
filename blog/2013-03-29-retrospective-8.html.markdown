- __What’s the most confusing component of Rails? Why? Could it be simpler, or is it just solving a difficult problem?__

After working on our own rails project for a week, i’d have to say the most difficult part is understanding where and how it works and can be customized. 

Similar to how bootstrap makes graphic design decisions for you, Rails does the same thing about all the parts of making a web application. There’s a huge amount of knowledge and pre-written code that needs to be understood before it can be optimized/customized/leveraged. 

- __What did you think about the increased emphasis on pairing this week? Was it productive for you? Why or why not? What’s challenging when you’re pairing, and what’s easier?__

It was a great idea, but i think the implementation could use some tweaking. Our group has been pairing through most of the project, and the ‘structured pairing’ seemed to push everyone off their path and halt momentum. 

It would have been interesting to make the 2nd pairing opt-in, to see if the people who said they liked it felt _that_ strongly. 
 
- __This is your first project working in groups larger than two. Do you feel like your progress is moving faster? If so, how much faster? What’s been fun and what’s been challenging about a larger group?__

Its been great, the group members are solely to credit. All three of us are motivated towards learning and seeing the entire project grow from a raw rails project into a professional e-commerce store. 
It feels like we’re going slow while we’re writing the code, but as we check-in with other groups, we’re motivated to hear that we’ are further along. We are one of the groups that is round-robin-pairing, it doesn’t feel like a long term solution but as we’re learning i think each of us is really happy with our progress. 

- __What should we expect to see in your demo Thursday? Will it be amazing, decent, or crap?__
Ironing-Boards, Cannons, Bananas..
