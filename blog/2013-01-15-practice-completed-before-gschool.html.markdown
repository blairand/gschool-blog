For reference, a list of practice I have completed prior to [gSchool](http://www.gschool.it). 

- On codecademy.com i had completed 2/3rds of the javascript lessons and 1/2 of the ruby lessons
- [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) from jumpstart labs
- [MicroBlogger](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html) from jumpstart labs
- quickly went through the [hartl rails book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) and skipped all testing
- One week training at marakana, [intro to ruby and rails](http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html) taught by [Ren√©e De Voursney](https://github.com/reneedv)

outside of that, I created a few random rails apps. [teachcamp](http://www.teachcamp.com) and [sushipad](http://sushipad.herokuapp.com)

In college i studied business(entrepreneurship) which mostly helped me remember how to spell the word entrepreneurship without guessing.
